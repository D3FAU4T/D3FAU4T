# FOR THE CURIOUS

Hmmmm, I see someone curious to find out how the icons and markdowns are made 🤔
Fear not! I'll leave references to whatever I used to make this 😉

- [Shields.io] (https://shields.io/)
  You can use this awesome tool to make unique badges for yourself. It can be both static and dynamic too 👍
  
- [md-badges] (https://github.com/inttter/md-badges)
  These are a good templates for the badges, it can save you a lot of time, just 🔎 here!

# Hey there! 👋 I'm 𝔻𝟛𝔽𝔸𝕌𝟜𝕋

I'm a college student and developer from India, passionate about coding, exploring new technologies and creating efficient, scalable solutions! I started my journey with **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)** and **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**, and right now I'm delving into **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)** and **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** to broaden my skillset.

I enjoy building projects that combine my interest in automation and data scraping, with a focus on expanding my skills in Programming through diverse, hands-on experiments.

> [!NOTE]
> I learned **browser's plain JavaScript** \**after*\* learning **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)** 😅

## 🌱 What I'm Learning:
I'm always eager to learn more, and right now I'm focused on:
- **General Scripting with Rust** to enhance my skills and knowledge with the language
- **C programming** for DSA and making CLI programs
- **Advanced React** for building complex UIs

## 🚀 Major Projects
### 🤖 [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-%235865F2.svg?&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.com/)
I created a Discord bot using **[Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)** to automate some of the repeating tasks on Discord, import a game "[Semantle](https://semantle.com/)" on discord and also play music in voice channels on [Discord](https://discord.com/).

### 🤖 [![Twitch](https://img.shields.io/badge/Twitch-%239146FF.svg?logo=Twitch&logoColor=white)](https://twitch.tv/)
I've built several bots on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) using [Tmi.js](https://tmijs.com/) to help streamers with their personal commands and needs.

### 🪟 [![Windows](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Windows-0078D6?logo=windows11&logoColor=white)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows11)
I have also re-built the aforementioned project as a Windows application using both [WinForms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/overview/?view=netdesktop-8.0) and [WinUI 3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) framework afterwards for that modern Windows 11 like design. I just wanted to learn how to make Windows Applications and the users also preferred an easy interface rather than executing code in terminal.

### 🎮 ![Rockstar Games](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rockstar%20Games-Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V-green?logo=rockstargames)
I have made a **single-player only** mod-menu for GTA V before using [Lemon UI](https://github.com/LemonUIbyLemon/LemonUI) framework. However, I've stopped working on that project and deleted everything a year ago for obvious reasons :)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't ask for mod menus with multiplayer. I don't need legal issues with Rockstar North.
